    How to run the benchmarks
    -------------------------

Either run it directly after uncommenting the ending (format ...):
$ sbcl --script nbody.lisp

Or via the harness script:
$ sbcl --script harness.lisp Nbody 1 250000

Or run the whole suite against diverse implementations to produce a pretty TSV:
$ ./bench.sh 5 50 >results.tsv


    Notes
    -----

* Try with fast-generic-functions, as generic functions are still slow.
* CCL fails at NBody with inner-iterations = 250000 due to
  https://github.com/Clozure/ccl/issues/422
* CLISP in interpreter mode is commented out in bench.sh because it is too damn
  slow for my taste and the bytecode compiler works well.
* In bounce: abs should be useless in (bounce ball).
* The results in tree were made on the following configuration:
$ uname -a

    ToDo
    ----

Some more -opt versions
Try with Clasp, ABCL and GCL
Find a way to try with LispWorks/Allegro?
